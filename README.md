# Measuring real broadband speeds using crowdsourcing data from the Internet Foundation

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU, the UN specialized agency for ICTs)is carrying out a series of pilot studies under the umbrella of the project Big Data for Measuring the Information Society.

The objective of the project is to show how big data from the telecommunication industrycan be used to produce new ICT indicators and replace or complement existing ones with a view to measuring the development of the Information Society worldwide.

In particular, these pilot studies aim to be a first step towards filling in the ICT data gaps in the global indicator framework agreed for the monitoring the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to inform private and public stakeholders on the current status of the digital divide.

The object of my master thesis concerns the measurements on broadband speeds carried out by the Internet Foundation in Sweden (IIS) and made available to ITU in the context of the project Big Data for Measuring the Information Society.

In this repository, I will share the results of this MSc thesis.
